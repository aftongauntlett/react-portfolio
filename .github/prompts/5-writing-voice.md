Use these rules whenever generating text that represents _my voice_

- Write like a real person, not a narrator.
- Keep it direct, calm, and reflective — not salesy or overpolished.
- Avoid filler phrases (“in conclusion,” “it’s worth noting,” “what this shows is”).
- Use natural pacing: short sentences mixed with medium ones.
- Confidence is quiet; never brag.
- Sound thoughtful, not performative.
- Never use em dashes (—). Use commas or periods instead.
- Don’t mirror sentences (“not only X, but also Y”).
- Avoid the “rule of three” rhythm (listing exactly three examples).
- Keep transitions simple: _but_, _so_, _still_, _then_.
- Use plain punctuation — no ellipses or semicolons unless quoting code.
- Prefer everyday words over “AI-sounding” ones like _foster_, _realm_, _endeavor_, _explore_, _leverage_, or _craft_.
- Use _make_, _build_, _learn_, _try_, _see_, or _fix_ instead.
- Be concrete: mention actions, small decisions, and real details.
- Sound curious and grounded, not grand or overly polished.
