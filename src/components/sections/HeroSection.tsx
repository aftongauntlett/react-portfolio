        I’m a front-end developer who builds interfaces that don’t make people
        angry. I care about accessible layouts, clean architecture, and little
        design details that make things feel better without calling attention to
        themselves. I like UI that’s quiet, thoughtful, and built to scale. I
        like writing code that doesn’t get in its own way. This portfolio is
        where I try to do both.
